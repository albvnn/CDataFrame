# CDataFrame Project - README

Welcome to the CDataFrame project!

This project aims to implement a data structure in C called CDataFrame. This structure allows you to manipulate datasets organized into columns, offering various data interaction and analysis functionalities.

## Project Description
In this project, we have developed a library in C to create and manipulate DataFrames, similar to what is offered in high-level languages like Python. The CDataFrame is a flexible data structure for storing tabular data with features for adding, deleting, modifying, and analyzing data.

Project Link : https://github.com/Akes-exe/CDataFrame

## How to Use the Library
### Prerequisites
- Operating System: Any system compatible with GCC or another C compiler
- C Compiler: GCC recommended

### Steps to Use the Library
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akes-exe/CDataFrame.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd projet-cdataframe
```
3. Compile the source files using your C compiler:
```bash
gcc main.c column.c cdataframe.c sort.c double-linked-list.c menu.c utils.c -o CDataFrame
```
4. Run the generated executable:
```bash
./CDataFrame
```

Then follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the library and use its features.

## Features

### 1. Creation and Filling
- **Create an Empty CDataframe**: Start with a blank slate by creating an empty CDataframe, ready to be filled with your data.
- **Fill the CDataframe with User Input**: Manually enter data to populate your CDataframe through an intuitive user input interface.
- **Hard Fill the CDataframe**: Pre-populate the CDataframe with predefined data, ideal for testing or demonstration purposes.
- **Import a CSV File into a CDataframe**: Easily import data from CSV files into your CDataframe, allowing for quick and seamless data integration.

### 2. Display
- **Display the Entire CDataframe**: View all the data in your CDataframe in one comprehensive display.
- **Display a Part of the Rows**: Specify a limit to view a subset of rows from your CDataframe, making it easier to analyze large datasets.
- **Display a Part of the Columns**: Specify a limit to view a subset of columns, allowing for focused analysis on specific data attributes.
- **Export the CDataframe to CSV**: Export your CDataframe data to a CSV file for sharing, reporting, or further processing in other tools.

### 3. Usual Operations
- **Add a Row of Values**: Insert a new row of data into your CDataframe, expanding your dataset as needed.
- **Delete a Row of Values**: Remove unwanted or incorrect data by deleting rows from your CDataframe.
- **Add a Column**: Introduce new attributes to your data by adding columns to your CDataframe.
- **Delete a Column**: Clean up your dataset by removing unnecessary or obsolete columns.
- **Rename a Column Title**: Update the titles of your columns for better clarity and understanding of the data.
- **Check for Existence of a Value**: Search your CDataframe to see if a particular value exists, aiding in quick data validation.
- **Access/Replace Cell Value**: Directly access or update the value in a specific cell using its row and column number for precise data manipulation.

### 4. Analysis and Statistics
- **Display Number of Rows**: Quickly determine the size of your dataset by viewing the total number of rows.
- **Display Number of Columns**: Understand the breadth of your data by seeing the total number of columns.
- **Count Cells Equal to a Value**: Find out how many cells contain a specific value for quick statistical insights.
- **Count Cells Greater Than a Value**: Identify cells with values greater than a specified number to assess data distributions.
- **Count Cells Less Than a Value**: Identify cells with values less than a specified number to assess data distributions.

### 5. Operations on Columns
- **Create a Column**: Add new columns to your CDataframe to expand your data structure.
- **Insert Value in a Column**: Populate specific columns with values, enhancing the detail and depth of your data.
- **Insert Value at a Position in a Column**: Insert values at specific positions within a column for precise data entry.
- **Free Memory of a Column**: Optimize memory usage by releasing memory allocated to unused columns.
- **Display Column Content**: View all values within a column to analyze and understand data trends.
- **Sort a Column**: Organize data by sorting column values in ascending or descending order.
- **Display Sorted Column Content**: View the contents of a sorted column to easily spot patterns and anomalies.
- **Delete Column Index**: Remove the index of a column when it is no longer needed.
- **Check Column Index**: Verify if a column has an index to ensure data integrity.
- **Update Column Index**: Modify the index of a column to reflect changes in data structure.

### 6. Search
- **Count Occurrences of a Value**: Determine how frequently a specific value appears in your CDataframe.
- **Return Value at Position**: Retrieve the value located at a specific position in your CDataframe.
- **Count Values Greater Than a Given Value**: Find out how many values exceed a specified threshold.
- **Count Values Less Than a Given Value**: Find out how many values fall below a specified threshold.
- **Count Values Equal to a Given Value**: Get the total count of cells matching a particular value.
- **Perform Binary Search**: Efficiently search for values using binary search algorithms for quick data retrieval.

### Additional Features
- **Manage Multiple CDataframes and Columns**: Create and manage multiple CDataframes and Columns simultaneously. Select the CDataframe or Column you wish to modify, providing flexibility and control over your data management tasks.
